Source water samples were also collected during summer base flow from one outfall pipe in each creek watershed drainage. Alaska Water Quality Standards for acute aquatic life for copper were exceeded in Hoadley and Ketchikan Creeks. Fecal coliform bacteria criteria were exceeded in all three creeks, with the Escherichia coli criteria also being exceeded in Ketchikan Creek. Microbial source tracking analysis detected human fecal bacteria DNA markers in all three creeks. Copper and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)anthracene and pyrene) in sediment were above the screening threshold in Ketchikan Creek, and metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found in water and sediment of all the creek outfall pipes.
