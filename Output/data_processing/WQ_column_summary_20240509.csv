SamplingDesignTypeCode,character,3,"NA; Targeted - A targeted sample is where a ""sample"" of the subject matter; be that people; plants/animals etc is selected using certain criteria; i.e. pregnant mothers between the ages of 25-30. Targeted samples are usually used by businesses or companies carrying out surveys on a particular group of people.; Probabilistic - A probability sampling method is any method of sampling that utilizes some form of random selection. In order to have a random selection method; you must set up some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have equal probabilities of being chosen."
